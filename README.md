The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge of C language acquired during the course to create a game.

As a result, Gravity Toss was created—a game where the player throws a ball to hit a target while considering the gravitational forces of both the Earth and the Moon.

Here’s a video of me playing the game: https://youtu.be/oDVoEmcs4WU?si=QMEl52G4rBgO6kvv (Please turn on the English subtitles).

The complete C++ files are uploaded as cpp_files.zip.

A general overview and explanation of the game are provided in presentation.pptx.
